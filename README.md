- **Message History**: View and scroll through previous conversations
- **Document Upload**: Upload documents to extend the knowledge base
- **Citation Support**: View sources for information provided in responses
- **Customizable Themes**: Light and dark mode support
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and user-specific chat histories

## Technology Stack

- **React**: UI library for building the user interface
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling for faster development
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **React Router**: For navigation between different views
- **Axios**: For API communication with the backend
